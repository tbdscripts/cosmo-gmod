# Garry's Mod Integration
Using this Garry's Mod addon allows you to automate your Cosmo store with Garry's Mod.

## Setting Up
1. Download this repository as a ZIP file.
    - Click on the green "Code" button on the top right.
    - Click "Download ZIP"
2. Place the folder inside your server's `addons` folder.
3. Configure the configs found in `lua/cosmo/config/` (only `sh_config.lua` and `sv_config.lua`).
4. Restart your server.

## Notes
This addon will soon be rewritten. The direct database integration will be replaced with an abstraction layer provided by your Cosmo instance's API endpoints.
